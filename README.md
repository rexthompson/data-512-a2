DATA 512, Fall 2017, Assignment 2: Bias in Data


Alyssa [1:00 PM]  
I am having trouble finding licensing or terms of use information for ORES. Can we assume it has the same licensing as Wikimedia pages? https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

@Alyssa good assumption to work with! Personally I would make the argument that it shouldn’t have copyright at all - but CC-BY-SA is otherwise a solid way to go.





Libby Montague [8:31 PM]  
I'm not able to find the licensing information for the ORES or the Population Reference Bureau data. It looks like above Alyssa asked about the ORES data and said that we could make an assumption about the license for the data. (1) Can we use the data is no license is provided? (2) Should we mention that no license was provided? (3) Am I missing the license of the Population Reference Bureau?


ironholds [8:42 PM]  
In sequence: (1) I’d explicitly Cc-0 it, (2) if you’d like! In fact you can ask the lead developer on Thursday! (3) it doesn’t in fact have one - the data is copyrighted and shouldn’t be incorporated into the repo. Do the instructions say it should be? :/. But either way I’d just note that it’s copyrighted by the PRB


Mike Browne [3:53 PM]  
Regarding the visualization:  10 lowest-ranked countries in terms of number of GA and FA quality articles as a proportion of all articles.  I'm getting 39 countries with zero GA/FA quality articles.  How would you suggest ranking these 39 countries?  By total number of articles?  In other words choose the 10 countries which have the highest total number of articles.

I would make them all 'tied' for last place.


[3:55]  
ordering among them doesn't matter, if they all have the same value
