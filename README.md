I am having trouble finding licensing or terms of use information for ORES. Can we assume it has the same licensing as Wikimedia pages? https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

@Alyssa good assumption to work with! Personally I would make the argument that it shouldnâ€™t have copyright at all - but CC-BY-SA is otherwise a solid way to go.
